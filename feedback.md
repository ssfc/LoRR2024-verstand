A heartfelt thank you to the organizers for hosting such an inspiring competition. My name is Ye Gao (Team verstand), a PhD student from the Smart Lab at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where my research focuses on Multi-Agent Pathfinding. This competition has been an incredible platform for me to collaborate with my lab teammates and learn from talented participants across the globe. One takeaway from this experience: while intelligence is essential, I’ve realized that physical endurance also play a crucial role—something I’ll be sure to work on in the future.
