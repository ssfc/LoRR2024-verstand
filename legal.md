## Offline Preprocessing

https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/evaluation

During the preprocessing stage, the current map is revealed. You then have an opportunity to analyse the map and compute auxiliary data before proceeding to the evaluation stage (e.g., initialise data structures, load models, etc). Preprocessing time is limited to 30 minutes per map. Nothing you do at this stage will be counted into your final score.
